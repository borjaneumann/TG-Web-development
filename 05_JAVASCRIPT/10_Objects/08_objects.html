    <h1>JS opdracht 8 // JSON</h1>
    <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation</p>

    <p>JSON is a lightweight <em>format</em>  for storing and transporting data, exchanging data from one computer to another. It was created by Dougkas Crickford<p>
        
    <p>JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page</p>
        
    <p>JSON is "self-describing", completely independent from any programming language and easy to understand. Thanks to this you could use javascript for the sender and the receiver could you Python</p>
    <h3>JSON Syntax Rules
        <ul>
            <li>Data is in name/value pairs</li>
            <li>Data is separated by commas</li>
            <li>Curly braces hold objects</li>
            <li>Square brackets hold arrays</li>
        </ul>  
    </h3>
    <h3>JavaScript Object Notation</h3>
    <p>The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects</p>
    <p>Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.</p>
    <p>The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.</p>
